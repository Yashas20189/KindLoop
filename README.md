# KindLoop

KindLoop is a community-driven platform where individuals can **donate or share unused items** with people in need. It promotes acts of kindness by rewarding users with points for helping others — either directly by donating or indirectly by connecting donors and recipients. These points serve as a **social symbol of kindness and helpfulness**, making generosity visible and appreciated in the digital world.
